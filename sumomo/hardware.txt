Please note that this is different from E8372. The first step is to test the hardware. 

### Testing it as a stand alone doogle
Remove the cover
Take a picture of the SSID, and the key name
Need a micro sim to standard sim card converted
Please note that when you insert your sim card, the metal part of the sim card is facing down.
When you slide the sim card in there is a tendency for the microsim to be detached.
Close the cover, and plug it into any usb slot
Then you will see there is a cyan light. 
If you get a blinking green light that means it cannot connect to the internet
Use your phone or computer to login to the SSID and key in the key you recorded.
Go to 192.168.8.1

### Plug it into the pi
```
lsusb --verbose
```
Look for 
```
idVendor           0x12d1 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.
idProduct          0x14db E353/E3131
```
Run this to convert to modem mode. You only need to do this once.
```
usb_modeswitch -v 12d1 -p 14db -M "55534243123456780000000000000a11062000000000000100000000000000"
```
Then you can use nmtui to activate eth1. Ping the connection using that specific device.
```
ping -I eth1 www.google.com
```
